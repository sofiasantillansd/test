    think of an advocacy that you can promote online (ex advocacy for frontliners, for women, for the poor, for the environment)

    About: What is your advocacy? Why did you choose this advocacy
    Vision and Mission: State the goals and guiding principles of your society advocacy
    Programs: Tell us about your programs that you plan to implement so that you may be able to achieve the vision and mission of your organization or movement.
